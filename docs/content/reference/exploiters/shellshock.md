### Description

This exploit, CVE-2014-6271, is based on the [logic in NCC group's GitHub](https://github.com/nccgroup/shocker/blob/master/shocker.py).

> In GNU Bash (through 4.3), processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment. This is demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, AKA "ShellShock."
