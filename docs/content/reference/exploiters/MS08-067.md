### Description

[MS08-067](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-067) is a remote code execution vulnerability.

This exploiter is unsafe. It's therefore **not** enabled by default.

If an exploit attempt fails, this could also lead to a crash in Svchost.exe. If a crash in Svchost.exe occurs, the server service will be affected. This may cause a system crash due to the use of buffer overflow.
